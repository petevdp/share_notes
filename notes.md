## questions

- can I provide an interface for commit messages?

## debt

- there are some type mismatches for certain gql queries with overly generic response types
- sometimes we get an error involving setting options on the editors when we create a room
- some bad ambiguous type names

# optional gists

- save back to gist action has to be conditional
- need to make gistName optional
- add link gist action

# anonymous rooms

# performance
