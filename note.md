# Notes

## Concept

Collaboratively edit notes and export them to a few common places quickly and easily.

## Target Audience

people who like markdown and github/dislake word processors

## Flow

go to home page
sign user in if they have linked their github

click new workspace button
if no account, then we ask them to give us a name or sign in via github

add a file by:

- dragging and dropping file from desktop
- linking to a gist
  - if you link to a gist, we might also ask for 0Auth so we can write back to it
- linking to a file in a github repo

* google drive
* idk some other note taking apps

copy link to workspace via button

edit notes collaboratively

save notes by

- download
  - if multiple, zip
  - **stretch** if we've already downloaded a file like this before, give it a unique name (maybe date or just simple versioning with underscore)
- save back to gist or create a new one
